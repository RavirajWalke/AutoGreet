        <h4>If someone is suffering a birthday memory loss and often get beaten up by wife,embarrassed by friends for forgetting their birthdays.</h4>
        <h4>To overcome this tendency of mine, I made this cool tool for my rescue.</h4>
        <h4>My code in the phone scans the application database filled with people’s information for their birthdate to match with the current date.
        If it matches, the code sends an SMS to the person’s mobile number and to the owner mobile as well (for owner’s reminder) automatically.</h4>
        <h4>Now no need to remember any birthday, just feed it once in the application and forget it. The code will take care of the rest.</h4>
